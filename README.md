### Algorithms in TypeScript

This repository contains a collection of implementations based on the book "Algorithms" by Robert Sedgewick. All code is written in TypeScript.

#### Prerequisites:

- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
- You'll also need TypeScript and `ts-node` installed globally. If you haven't installed them, run:
  ```bash
  npm install -g typescript ts-node
  ```

#### Running the code:

Each algorithm is implemented in its own TypeScript file. To run any of the implementations, use the following command:

```bash
ts-node <filename.ts>
```

Replace `<filename.ts>` with the name of the file you wish to run.
